# Introduction

This is my first cli app using NodeJS. It is a CRUD Functionality cli tool using which you can Create, Read, Update and Delete customers in the database.

Building this tool all by myself from scratch helped me learn a lot of new things like working with several cli building tools including chalk, inquirer, commander and also helped me revise some backend development concepts I had lost touch with.

## How does it work?
